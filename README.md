Ultra simple ham radio logbook

For log my contacts, I made my own logbook. 
It's writen in PHP and uses a MySQL database. 
My motivation came since I couldn't find a simple logbook.

Install
-------

1 - Create the database:
mysql> create database logbook;

2 - Create the tables using the "create_tables" script under the install directory

3 - Configure the db.php file according with your settings
